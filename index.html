              It's that time of year: Thanksgiving is Thursday. And, like most
              holiday celebrations in 2020, it's going to look different this
              November. Public health officials are warning Americans about the
              dangers of travel and gatherings as the coronavirus pandemic
              rages. Stores nationwide are closing their doors Thanksgiving Day,
              while families finalize what recipes they'll enjoy together
              (perhaps virtually). And many Indigenous people will commemorate
              the 50th National Day of Mourning, amid overdue need of being
              honest about the holiday's true history.
